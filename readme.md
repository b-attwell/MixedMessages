## Description

This is an off-platform Codecademy project. The main aim was to build a message generator program that, every time the user runs a program, should return a new, randomised output in their terminal. This program uses random gym messages as an example.

More specific project objectives included:
+ Using Git version control
+ Utilising the command line
+ Developing locally with JavaScript
